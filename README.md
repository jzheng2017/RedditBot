# RedditBot
RedditBot is a school project.

The purpose of the bot is to search for certain keywords on Reddit. 

For example: "!Search Car", it looks for "!Search" if it finds it, then it takes everything after "!Search", and looks up information on the internet for "Car". It returns information and replies to the comment with the information in a certain format.
